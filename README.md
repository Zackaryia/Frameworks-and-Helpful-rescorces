# Frameworks-and-Helpful-rescorces
A notepad of frameworks that help me

1. Ngrok
https://ngrok.com/

Ngrok allows you to host a website from your pc / local host and have it create a url to allow users to connect to your local host from the interwebs

Things I want to learn

1. Django (a lot more indepth)

2. Rust (a language like c++ with no memory leaks and a loving fan base)
